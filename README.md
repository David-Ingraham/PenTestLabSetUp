## Software Installation

[Download link for Virtual Machine]( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Be sure to verify the checksum of the download package, this is a relevant securtiy concern for all software downloaded off the internet. The checksum verifies the integrity of the file downloaded to insure it comes from the source you think it does. The website hosting the software to be dowloaded will have hashed ([more info on hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function )) thier sofware and created the checksum. If you locally hash the dowloaded file you can check that the hashes match.

The downloads for different operatings systems with have thier own hashes, so make sure your comparing the right ones.

Once you download the right package, follow the steps below in a bash or zsh shell below to ensure the hashes match. 

1.Create new file, hash download and write has to new file
  ```bash
    touch localHash.txt
    shasum -a 256 FILE_NAME_OF_DOWNLOAD >> localHash.txt

  ```
2. Create file for website hash and write to it
   ```bash
     touch sourceHash.txt
     echo HASH_FROM_WEBSITE >> sourceHash.txt
   ```
3. Compare hashes
   ```bash
     diff -c localHash.txt sourceHash.txt
