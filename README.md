This repo walks you through the process of how to set up a virtual machine running Kali Linux for completing HackTheBox modules. 

I was using my mac for modules/challenges that used curl for getting flags from web servers or netcat (nc) for finding flags through tcp connections. Once I progressed far enough into the modules, I needed more tools like smbclient. I realized I had to dowload a vm and install kali.



[Download link for Virtual Machine]( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Be sure to verify the checksum of the download package, this is a relevant securtiy concern for all software downloaded off the internet. The checksum verifies the integrity of the file downloaded to insure it comes from the source you think it does. The website hosting the software to be dowloaded will have hashed ([more info on hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function )) thier sofware and created the checksum. If you locally hash the dowloaded file you can check that the hashes match.

The downloads for different operatings systems with have thier own hashes, so make sure your comparing the right ones.

Once you download the right package, follow the steps below in a bash or zsh shell below to ensure the hashes match. 

1.Create new file, hash download and write has to new file
  ```bash
    touch localHash.txt
    shasum -a 256 FILE_NAME_OF_DOWNLOAD >> localHash.txt

  ```
2. Create file for website hash and write to it
   ```bash
     touch sourceHash.txt
     echo HASH_FROM_WEBSITE >> sourceHash.txt
   ```
3. Compare hashes
   ```bash
     diff -c localHash.txt sourceHash.txt

   ```
     
Once you have VirtualBox installed, now its time to upload an image. Get the .iso file for Kali liux from the official website and add it as a new machine. On the banner on the top of your screen (Mac iOS) click machine, new and select the iso image from your file manager. I suggest creating a shared folder in the virtual box manger so you can access the vpn connection file needed to connect to the HTB servers. The shared file will be in the /media folder if you're using a linux os on the virtual box. I created my account on my host OS, so I only had access to HTB from that OS. The shared file allowed me to access the connection file, (containing keys, certificates) from my kali machine easily like so 

```bash
    openvpn /media/shared_folder/connection_file.ovpn
```
